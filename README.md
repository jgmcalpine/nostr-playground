## Nostr playground for learning and testing things out

## Why Nostr?

Bitcoin has shown the power of public key cryptography to give users greater control and ownership over their digital lives. Similarly, Nostr embodies the principles that Bitcoin was founded on: decentralization, censorship resistance, privacy, and individual sovereignty. To understand why Nostr is important we must understand how these principles apply to Nostr.

## Decentralization

Bitcoin removes the need for centralized financial intermediaries, and Nostr does the same for online communication. Platforms like Twitter or Facebook centralize control over user data, content moderation, and algorithms. Nostr decentralizes this by relying on a network of relays, making it impossible for any single entity to control or censor communication.

## Censorship resistance

On Nostr, censorship is difficult because users can self-host relays (which we hope to do soon) and interact with any number of independent relays of their choosing. Also, cryptographic signatures ensure the integrity of messages, preventing tampering or impersonation.

## Privacy and Pseudonymity

You don't need to sign up with an email, phone, or any other personally indentifiable information. There is no central authority issuing keys or identities.

## Open source
